# GitHub Pages (Web Hosting) @ St. Thomas - Read Me First

# What is GitHub Pages?
GitHub Pages changes your standard GitHub repositories into hosted websites, which you can customize however you want. This is ideal if you have built a website for a specific course, conference, or project; if you need personal control of your website at your fingertips; if you have some knowledge of how to write HTML webpage code; and if you don't want (or can't have) university branding on your web content. Content that previously lived on PersonalWeb or CourseWeb are ideally suited for migration to St. Thomas's GitHub Pages.

# How it Works
1. Create your HTML/CSS/JS website on your local computer (or, if it already exists, get a copy of it from CourseWeb). 
  - If you don't have any idea how to make a webpage, GitHub Pages *may* not be the right solution for you, but talk to ITS.

2. [Create a repository](https://github.com/organizations/UniversityOfSaintThomas/repositories/new) within the University of St. Thomas organization.
  - The name you choose for this repository will be part of the your website's URL when you are done, so pick a good one!
  - Set the repository visibility to Public. (If you set the visibility to Private or Internal, [as your normally would](https://github.com/UniversityOfSaintThomas/StThomas_ReadMeFirst/), your website will have a randomly generated URL.
