# St. Thomas GitHub Campus - Read Me First
Welcome!

# Purpose
This GitHub organization allows individuals and teams throughout the St. Thomas community to easily store code in a central St. Thomas hub; to seamlessly share code with anyone at St. Thomas; and to make collaboration on code projects a breeze, whether within a single classroom or across multiple colleges.

# How It Works
## GitHub and Git
If you are new to Git and GitHub, learn more with GitHub's [guides](https://guides.github.com/) and [labs](https://lab.github.com/). It can also be helpful to explore training for [Git](https://git-scm.com/doc), the technology at the heart of GitHub.

## Structure
The St. Thomas *organization* is the owner of all *repositories* stored within the org. The creator of a repository is its default *admin*. The admin decides which other teams and individuals can access the repository and exactly how much control to grant them.

## Logging in
Our GitHub Campus works by linking users' GitHub accounts to their St. Thomas accounts. When you first try to log in, go to https://github.com/orgs/UniversityOfSaintThomas/sso . You will be prompted to log into both your St. Thomas account and your GitHub account. (You will be prompted to create a GitHub account if you do not already have one.) After that, your accounts will remain permanently linked. Anyone with a valid St. Thomas account (including xtra- accounts) can join our GitHub Campus organization.

# Teams
The St. Thomas organization contains a number of *teams*. You can view the existing teams here: https://github.com/orgs/UniversityOfSaintThomas/teams . At this writing, ITS has created only a few teams focused on ITS, but we plan to add more soon. You can also create your own teams.

Teams can be *synchronized* or *unsynchronized*. 

### Synchronized Teams
A synchronized team is connected to a specific St. Thomas Active Directory group (like "Group: Chess Club" or "Biology Faculty and Staff DG"). GitHub Campus "syncs" with St. Thomas Active Directory once every hour and automatically updates the members of your synchronized GitHub Campus team. Anyone who has joined the A.D. group is added to the team; anyone who is no longer in the A.D. group is removed. This means you don't have to deal with constantly managing team membership when new employees or students are hired and others depart; Active Directory handles all that behind-the-scenes.

You can find a list of the most commonly-used A.D. groups in [Outlook People Online](https://outlook.office.com/people/) under Directory >> All Distribution Groups (on the left sidebar). Some of these groups are created and managed automatically by Outlook. Others, especially the ones with the "Group:" prefix, are managed manually by Outlook group owners. 

If you are a team's admin (or are creating a team), you can connect it to a St. Thomas Active Directory group using the Identity Provider Groups option in the team's Settings >> General tab (or on the team creation screen). The Identity Provider Groups lookup menu searches A.D. for groups that match what you've typed in.

*Tip: The lookup menu is not a freeform search, but a quite rigid lookup; if the group you are looking for is called "Group: UST Chemistry Department Stockroom," you must type in "Group: UST Chem" to find it. Typing in just "Chemistry" will not find it.*

### Unsynchronized Teams
An unsynchronized team is created in GitHub but not connected to any St. Thomas group. The team's admin must manually manage its member list within GitHub campus. This is done through the team's Members tab. It is simpler to set up initially, but more arduous to manage. Unsynchronized teams may also have child teams. (Synchronized teams may not.)

### Team Creation Etiquette
Any user of the St. Thomas GitHub Campus Organization is free to create and manage teams -- as many as you want, synchronized or unsyncrhonized. However, we request that any teams you create be set to Secret (not Visible). The list of Visible teams is curated by ITS.
